# macOS runner

The macOS host-preparation API stages snapshots and resolves dependencies before
a job can be admitted to a VM. A preparation refusal is a refusal before start:
the job command has not run.

## Bun lockfiles

Host preparation supports the text `bun.lock` format. Binary `bun.lockb` files
are refused before dependency fetching or publication because host preflight
does not decode the binary format. The refusal names the `bun.lockb` path.

In the caller checkout, convert the lockfile with:

```sh
bun install --save-text-lockfile
```

Commit `bun.lock` and remove the superseded `bun.lockb` from the submitted
snapshot before retrying. The runner does not convert lockfiles or execute
caller lifecycle scripts on the host; dependency installation uses
`bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`.
